# Kerr-BH-RayTracing
This repository contains a Ray Tracer written in C++ with an OpenMP parallelization backend. Using a Python script it then visualizes the shadow of a rapidly rotating Kerr Black Hole (spin parameter α = 0.999) by numerically integrating null geodesics (photon paths) in curved spacetime.
